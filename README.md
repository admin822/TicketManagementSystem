# TicketManagementSystem

## Projects:

### 1.TicketGenerator(Tool project, not part of coding challenge)

1. Go into your account, use admin access to enable APIs with tokens and password/email
2. change the information in ```myLogin.properties``` to your own information
3. Run ```main.java```

### 2. MyTicketMaster_CLI
> Current build(0.0.2) has been tested on Windows 10 and CentOS Linux 8

#### How to use:
   - Download ```MyTicketMaster_CLI.rar```
   - Change information in ```login.properties``` to your logins. **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT move this file to other place, the App will complain.
   - Enter the root directory, run ```java -jar MyTicketMaster_CLI-0.0.2.jar```

##### For more technical users:
Under the *logs* directory, there will be a few    *.log* files:  
 - *error.log*: This shows all the exceptions generated during the most recent run of the App. If you see the app says ```'..., please refer to error.log for more details```, this is the place to look at.
- *request.log*: This contains the message from the API transmission(except from the response JSON of course)
- *any amount of .gz*: compressed files that include error.log from past runs of the App.

#### Code Structure:
1. At root directory of the program:
   - *log4j2.xml*: Configuration file of the logger
   - *login.properties*: This should include valid logins of the account that would provide the tickets used by this app.
   - */logs*: This folder contains all the logs that will be generated by the App
2. Under the /src directory:
   - *App.java*: The entrance of the CLI
   - */API*: This folder included the two kinds of API requests that will be needed to run this App.
   - */CLI*: This include the three 'webpages' that the CLI is consist of: Index, Ticket List View page, Single Ticket (searched by ID) View page
   - */Exceptions*: Custom exceptions
   - */Util*: Utility functions(the function that reads the users' logins is inlcuded here)
3. Under the /src/test directory: 
   - */APITest*: This folder includeds unit tests for functions in */API*
   - */UtilTest*: This folder includes unit tests for functions in */Util*

#### Testing:

Unit Test covers all Util functions, some branches of the API resquests. But due to the nature of some functions, it is hard or even impossible to perform unit test to cover all their possible branches(for example, the CLI pages' mistake handling behaviors when user type in invalid commands). Thus, some manual tests are performed to ensure the correct actions. Here is a list of manual tests that have been examined and passed:  

   | Description      | Passing Criteria |

   | Logins missing for Single Ticket View page   | 1. friendly verbose presented to users 2.   error logs are recorded        |
   | Logins missing for Ticket List View page   | 1. friendly verbose presented to users 2.   error logs are recorded        |

   | Invalid inputs for Tickets List View page(anything that is not 1,2 and 3)   | 1. friendly verbose presented to users     |
   | All tickets have been shown to the users   | 1. friendly verbose presented to users 2. return to main page    |
